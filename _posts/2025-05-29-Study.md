Hello!

### Reflection
- When make class,  Translaters make we that can read object and Interpret information and save.
- ordinary, use at make framework.
```py
class MyType:
    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
        self.x = x 
        self.y = y 
    def add(self):
        return self.x+self.y 
    
    def sub(self):
        return self.x-self.y 
    
    def mul(self):
        return self.x*self.y 
k=MyType(4,5)
for x in dir(MyType):
    if not x.startswith("__"):
        func=getattr(MyType,x)
        print(func.__name__)
        print(func(k))
```
example of Reflection.
Use dir and getattr Function, call functions and print name.
```py
import inspect
inspect.signature(object) # get pamamitor.
inspect.getmembers(object) #get members name.
inspect.isfunction(object) #inspect object is function.
inspect.stack() #get call order. but slow.(use only debuging)
```
use inspect module. 
```py
a={1:2,2:4,5:6}
it=iter(a) #return Iterator object.
print(next(it))
print(next(it))
```
Can use Type as same way.
