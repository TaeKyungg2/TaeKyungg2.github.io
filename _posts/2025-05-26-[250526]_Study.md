# Database theory

In phone, No exist Database. must with wep server then use.

## Database 
- In cumputer, for fast search,specify get organized information set.
- No duplicate, save in one repositiry, many user can share infomation
- Saved manage data for share many information at relevent group for Integration,saved.

## Goal of Database.
- consistion. No Dependency.
- decrease Dupilcate.
- can Share.
- security
- Integrity
  
## Fiture of Database.
- Good
  - Can Multi Use.
  - easy modify.
  - easy Manage.
- Bad
  - Price increse of Computerization
  - complication of system.
  - request manage person.
## configure of Database
  - data
  - hardware(repository)
  - software(DBMS)
  - Manage person.

## Relationship model : 
- Model that good grasp as between entity groups
- row named Tuple.
- colum named Attribute.
- domain : range of Attribute.(group)
## Express of Relationship model.
- Use foreign Key.
- relation : 1:1,1:n,n:m
- attribute : row. data feild
- domain : group of Can be value .
- primary Key : No dupilcation Attribute.
- candidate key : Can be primary key Attributes group.
## Model of hierarchy form
- Tree structure
## Model of Network
- like net.
## configure of database system
- schema :Logic structre of database Overall
    1. outer schema
    2. concept schema
    3. inner schema
- database
- Language
- DBMS
- user
## Database Language
- Data Definition Language
- Data Manipulation Language
- Query Language
- Data Control Language
# DBMS : Data Base Management System
## type of DBMS
- Netwerk type
- hierarchy type
- relation type
- ### used many Relational DBMS.
## popular DBMS.
- Oracle
- Ms-SQL
- Access
- MySQL
# Data Modeling
## Order of Data Modeling
1. information Modeling -> consept data model
2. data Modeling -> logit data model
3. data structured ->physical data model

### Logic structre
transaction : all or nothing
- no duplication
- do refund
- isolation
- Durability
- Atomiciy
- Consistency
- recover
  - rollback commend
  - commit commend

exsemple

```sql
start transaction
delete from emp;
select * from emp;
rollback;
update emp set ename='조승연' where empno=7902;
commit;
```
- rollback : get usually data.
- commit : confirmed. *if used, can't rollback.*

# Nomalization
- UNF : before Nomalization.
- 1NF : 합치다 duplicate colum.
- 2NF : 부분 종속 제가
- 3NF : 이행 함수의 종속을 제거한다.
- BNF : 모든 키가 후보 키다.
